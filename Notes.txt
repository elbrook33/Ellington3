Options for Ellington Desktop:

1. Don’t bother – I’ve had my programming fun, and LXDE is all I need.
2. Finish in C. I’ve put some nice tricks in there.
3. Use C++ – still lets me use libraries (especially XLib and NanoVG), but with a lot of niceties.
4. Get Swift going.
5. Something else (Nim? Go?)
